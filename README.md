"# sign-language-recognition" 
It is a machine learning project that measure the accuracy of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) vs Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) vs support vector machine (SVM).
And using cross validation on diffrent NNs to choose the best architecture to train it and we find that NN is better than SVM and classic classifier get poor accuracy on images but Neural network get high accuracy.
